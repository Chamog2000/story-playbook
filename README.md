# The Financial Times Story Playbook

The Financial Times has created a set of digital story templates to help its reporters and editors commission digital and visual stories. Collectively, they are called the Story Playbook.

The templates are built directly into our content management system, but the principles and thinking behind them are widely applicable for other newsrooms.

This Github repository contains the guides to using the templates. The guides are written for reporters and editors.

There are five Story Playbook templates:

### Profile Cards
_An article that introduces a group of people or other entities to the reader_

### Charticle
_An article that explains changes, or a trend, using a series of charts and graphs_

### Timeline Story
_An easy-to-update article that catches readers up on the story so far_

### Reader Response
_An article collecting the best of reader responses, either to a callout or in the comments section of a big story_

### Photo Essay
An article that lets readers see what has happened
