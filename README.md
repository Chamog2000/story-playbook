# The Financial Times Story Playbook

The Financial Times has created a set of digital story templates to help its reporters and editors commission digital and visual stories. Collectively, they are called the Story Playbook.

The templates are built directly into our content management system, but the principles and thinking behind them are widely applicable for other newsrooms.

Read more about how and why we created these templates at [Source Opennews](https://source.opennews.org/articles/story-templates-financial-times-reusable/)

There are five Story Playbook templates:

### [Profile Cards](https://github.com/ft-interactive/story-playbook/blob/master/FT%20Story%20Playbook_%20Profile%20Card%20Story.pdf)
_An article that introduces a group of people or other entities to the reader_
Example: [Who will replace Mark Carney as Bank of England governor?](https://www.ft.com/content/647a115a-6678-11e9-a79d-04f350474d62)

### [Charticle](https://github.com/ft-interactive/story-playbook/blob/master/FT%20Story%20Playbook_%20Charticle.pdf)

- Where can I find it?
- What is it good for?
- What is it not good for?
- What are good previous examples?
- How long does it take to make one of these?
